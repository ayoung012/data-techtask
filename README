### Tech Task ###

I chose to use Docker to spin up a Jupyter notebook environment. I chose an image relatively fit for purpose
rather than one with endless bells and whistles. I used mostly SQL where possible and numpy for maths type
analysis.



## Usage ##

```
# Clone the git repository
git clone https://github.com/ayoung012/data-techtask
# Enter the repository directory
cd data-techtask
# Build the docker image. This will update the image via apt-get and install some python dependancies
docker build -t data-techtask .
# Run the container, exposing port 8888 in order to view the jupyter notebook from a browser
docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 data-techtask

Once the food facts data has been successfully parsed, visit the Jupyter Notebook link as
per the command line instructions and enter the 'work' directory to access Tasks 1 & 2
```
